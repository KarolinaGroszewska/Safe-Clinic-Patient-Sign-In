# Safe-Clinic-Patient-Sign-In

Safe Clinic Patient Sign In is an app designed for the Nashville Sexual Assault Center that helps with patient intake. 
The app is designed to collect basic demographic information from incoming patients, including their signatures which are placed on the documents by writing with a finger, and have that information easily stored on a secure Google Firebase database for SAC staff to filter.

In order to run the app, download the entire file from github, and open the .xcworkspaces file found in the main folder to have access to the Firebase functionalities.

This app was built to run on Swift 5 and IOS 13, but it is compatible with earlier versions of IOS and easily converted to earlier or later versions of Swift.
